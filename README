Diamond Kata

The Diamond Kata is a code exercise that [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose) described in his blog post [Recycling tests in TDD](http://claysnow.co.uk/recycling-tests-in-tdd/).
I use this kata to work on TDD and more precisely on how to decompose a big problem in small ones and build the final solution using incremental steps with TDD.

## Kata Description

Given a letter, print a diamond starting with 'A' with the supplied letter at the widest point.

### Examples
```
Input: A

Output:   A
         B B
          A

Input: C
Output:   A
         B B
        C   C
         B B
          A
```
